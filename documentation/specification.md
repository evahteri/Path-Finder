# Path Finder
Path finder is an app to find the fastest route between two locations from a map. The user can choose between two algorthms which one they want to use and gets feedback on how efficient the chosen algorithm was finding the required path.

## Programming language
I am using python and I do not know any other programming languages for peer reviewing.

## Algorithms
The program includes two different path finding algorithms and shows their performance differences. The first one is IDA* and the other one is Dijkstra.

## User interface
TkInter is used as a graphic interface. There are two buttons to choose the algorithm and a search button. Future implementation would possibly include choosing freely the locations from the map. Fastest route is showed on the map as a line with the time that the result took from the algorithm.

## Other
My main subject/major in University of Helsinki is Tietojenk√§sittelytieteiden kandidaatti. The documentation and program is in English to make sure the whole project is cohesive.
