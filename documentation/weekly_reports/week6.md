# Week 4

## Plan
- Improve some of the things that was mentioned in peer review
- Continue performance testing
- More tests to make sure the right path is found
- Trying other, different sized maps
- Improvements on handling inputs

## Progress
- GUI now allows to change between maps and shows them
- Started working on making dijkstra work with bigger maps
- Dijkstra now works with any map
- IDA* now works with other maps
- Noticed that IDA* doesn't actually work with every input
- Got IDA* working, the problem was that I added the map's "walls" to the graph. Most of this week's time spent figuring this out.
- Made improved tests for the algorithms
