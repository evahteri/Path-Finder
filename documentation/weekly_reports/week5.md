# Week 4

## Plan
- Improve some of the things that was mentioned in peer review
- Start performance tests

## Progress
- Started working on an implementation of Floyd Warshall algorithm to get all shortest paths to test performance with different inputs. This is hard to implement as there are so many routes to every node. I will probably abandon this and count shortest paths to every node with my algorithms or something similiar.
- Created a task to launch performance tests.

## Learning progress
- Learnt about Floyd Warshall algorithm, especially why it is so slow


## Problems/questions
- How can I make sure I have found the shortest route with my algorithm in my map? All I can think of is to count it manually or test it with different algorithms.
