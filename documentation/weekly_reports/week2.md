# Week 1

## Plan
- Create own maps with less pixels than movingai's maps
- Starting working on Dijkstra
- Pytest setup
- Pylint setup
- Autopep setup

## Progress
- Custom map now shows in gui
- First version of Dijkstra working
- GUI shows visited nodes as yellow, fastest route as green.
- Dijkstra can probably still be optimized
- Haven't made my own data structures yet
- Pytest setup done and first test ready


## Learning progress
- Learned a lot from dijkstras theory

## Problems/questions
