# Week 1

## Plan
- Create own maps with less pixels than movingai's maps
- Starting working on Dijkstra
- Pytest setup
- Pylint setup
- Autopep setup

## Progress
- Custom map now shows in gui
- First version of Dijkstra done, not working yet as it should
- GUI shows visited nodes as red

## Learning progress
- Learned a lot from dijkstras theory

## Problems/questions
- Algorithm doesn't have a end node yet, still trying to figure out how to keep track of the fastest route
