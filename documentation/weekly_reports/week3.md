# Week 3

## Plan
- Start ida star implementation
- Start writing test document

## Progress
- Right now I'll test manhattan distance as a heuristic for IDA*
- IDA* finds fastest route
- GUI shows visited nodes as yellow
- Time spent finding route added to IDA*
- Created test document

## Learning progress
- Learned how some heuristics work and why IDA* uses less memory
- IDA* is considerably faster finding the fastest route in this map

## Problems/questions
