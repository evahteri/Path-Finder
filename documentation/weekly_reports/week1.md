# Week 1

## Plan
- Create a repository for the project
- Coming up with a plan for the project and the scale
- Writing the specification document
- Starting to code the basic functions, starting with ui

## Progress
- First version of GUI is working

## Learning progress
- Getting better at starting projects properly
- Photo in GUI using tkinter

## Problems/questions
- Can the map be treated as coordinates or should I select some coordinates as nodes? Both of the algorithms select routes based on the distances between nodes. If I go through every coordinate, every node has same distance to their neighbouring node (pixel/coordinate next to them).
